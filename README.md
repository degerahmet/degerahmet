# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmet

I build software by shipping real products and learning in public.

Most of my work focuses on **backend systems**, **APIs**, and **scalable architectures**, with a growing interest in **AI-powered products** and **developer tooling**.

This GitHub is my workshop; experiments, production systems, and things I’m actively learning.

---

## 🧠 What I care about

- Designing clean, scalable backend systems  
- Turning messy ideas into working products  
- Learning by building, not just reading  
- Shipping > over-engineering  
- Understanding *why* things work, not just *how*

---

## 🌍 Open source & writing

- Actively contributing **Turkish translations for Ubuntu**

- Writing about my technical learnings, experiments, and takeaways on **Medium**  
  → [https://medium.com/@ahmetdeger ](https://medium.com/@ahmetdeger) 

I enjoy sharing what I learn, especially the parts that aren’t obvious from docs.

## 🛠 Tech I work with

**Backend & Infra**
- Python, TypeScript
- Django, FastAPI, NestJS, Express
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- Docker, AWS, CI/CD

**Frontend (when needed)**
- React, Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

**AI & Automation**
- OpenAI API, LangChain
- Prompt engineering
- Agent-based workflows

---

## 🌱 Currently

- Exploring **Go** by building small tools and services  
- Working on multi-tenant platforms and real-time systems  
- Experimenting with AI agents in production-like environments  

---

## 🚀 Philosophy

I believe good engineers:
- build things that people actually use  
- understand trade-offs instead of chasing trends  
- learn continuously by breaking and fixing systems  

If something here helps you, feel free to use it.
